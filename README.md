In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that can describe displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data.
In practice, it is often enough for us to know the approximate value of a certain integral with some given degree of accuracy.

This project contains the implementation of some methods (rules) for calculating definite integrals:
1. [**Left Rectangles Method**](https://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-approximate-area-with-left-rectangles/)
2. [**Right Rectangles Method**](https://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-approximate-area-with-right-rectangles/)
3. [**Midpoint Rectangles Method**](https://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-approximate-area-with-midpoint-rectangles/)
4. [**Trapezoidal Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)
5. [**Simpson's Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule)
6. [**Romberg's Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method)
7. [**Monte Carlo Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration)
